    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Originally this came from a Cuban friend, but I've since doctored it quite a bit. 
            This dish is hearty and a meal in itself. By adding more meat, beans, and rice, 
            you can feed a large group of people. You might want to add more spice as well.
